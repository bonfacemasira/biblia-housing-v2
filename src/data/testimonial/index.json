    "description": "  recently purchased agricultural land in Eldoret through this agency. The team was very responsive and provided me with detailed information about the property. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is due to a slight delay in processing the land title transfer, but overall, it was a great experience, and the land is perfect for my farming projects"
